            <h1 class="h1s1">Season 1 Plot</h1>
            <p class = "s11">Audiences have been gripped right from that first Colossal Titan attack in the Shinganshina District, where the Smiling Titan ate Eren’s mother. After joining the Cadet Corps, Eren’s first battle is undeniably disastrous since he gets eaten by the Bearded Titan. But when he lands in the Titans stomach he’s enraged at the carnage the monsters have caused, ultimately transforming into one himself and bursting out of the Bearded Titan to slaughter the attacking monsters. </p>
            <p class ="s12"> Eren, Armin and Mikasa all wind up joining the Scout Regiment under Levi Ackerman and Erwin Smith. But a new enemy emerges when the two pet Titans Hange Zoȅ was experimenting on are mysteriously murdered by someone using omni-directional gear.</p>
            <p class = "s13"> It’s later revealed that Annie is the devastating Female Titan, and uses a bladed ring to reveal herself when Erwin and Armin confront her. After remembering all the pain the Titans have caused, Eren fights her in his monstrous form and savagely beats her while causing absolute chaos in the Stohess District. Before he can eat Annie, she crystalizes herself and is locked away by the Scout Regiment. The first season ends with a truly shocking revelation that there are Titans buried inside Wall Sina. </p>

            <h1 class="h1s2">Season 2 Plot</h1>
            <p class = "s21">With the mystery of the Wall Titans looming over the heroes and the introduction of fascinating new characters, Attack on Titan’s second season undeniably upped the action. After the introduction of the Beast Titan and the devastation it can cause, the series delves into the political history of the world through Christa Lenz. </p>
            <p class ="s22"> A flashback reveals Christa’s real name is Historia Reiss and she’s the illegitimate child of Rod Reiss, the King of Eldia. During the shocking sixth episode, Reiner breaks down in exhaustion and reveals to Eren that he’s the Armoured Titan and Bertholdt is the terrifying Colossal Titan that kick-started this whole saga for the audience.</p>
            <p class = "s23"> As the Scouts fight Titans being thrown by Reiner’s Armoured Titan, Eren winds up facing the Smiling Titan that ate his mother way back at the beginning of the series. In his anger, he unlocks a mysterious ability called the Founding Titan, allowing Eren to control any and all Titans. He uses it on those nearby and forces them to eat the Smiling Titan. That’s definitely one way to get revenge. The second season ends with the Beast Titan on Wall Maria while a mysterious blonde man says “Not just yet.” Oh, the suspense!</p>

            <h1 class="h1s3">Season 3 Plot</h1>
            <p class = "s31">The first half of the third season sees Commander Erwin and Squad Levi try to overthrow the corrupt royal Government headed by Rod Reiss, since Historia is the rightful heir to the throne. Meanwhile, Eren learns the shocking truth that his father, Grisha, is the one who turned him into a Titan in his home basement and a buried memory reveals Eren quickly ate his father after that first transformation. </p>
            <p class ="s32"> The Beast Titan is dramatically revealed to be Zeke Jaeger, Eren’s half-brother – who claims to be a victim of their father, Grisha. He’s trying to capture Eren so Marley has the Coordinate power to control Titans. Is this the most shocking familial reveal since Darth Vader? Possibly. During the same battle to take back the Shinganshina District, Armin distracts Bernholdt’s Colossal Titan so Eren can sneakily rip the villain out of his monstrous form. It comes at a price as Armin’s burnt alive and close to death. But after he’s revived using a serum of Titan spinal fluid, Armin shifts into a Titan and eats a limbless Bertholdt. Meaning he now holds the power to turn into the Colossal Titan.</p>
            <p class = "s33"> It all culminates in a bittersweet ending as the Survey Corps go on another expedition and find themselves standing at a beautiful ocean. It’s undermined by the realization that the war against Marley has only just begun.</p>

            <h1 class="h1s4">Season 4 Plot</h1>
            <p class = "s41">The season follows Gabi Braun and Falco Grice, young Eldian Warrior candidates seeking to inherit Reiner's Armored Titan four years after the failed mission to claim the Founding Titan. As Marley's dominance over competing nations begins to weaken due to the development of anti-titan weaponry, they plan to invade Paradis to develop their military using the resources on the island and also recover the Founding Titan. </p>
            <p class ="s42"> With tensions rapidly heating up and the Survey Corps on the Marley shoreline, Gabi, Falco, Reiner, and other Titans go to war with the Paradis soldiers as Eren Jaeger reveals his new plan of attack on the Marleyan invaders: annihilation. </p>
            <p class = "s43"> As war heats up and both sides take a heavy death toll, both the Marleyan Warriors and the Survey Corps must question the best approach to claiming victory over the other side. Eren's comrades begin to realize that he has begun to walk down a questionable path, while Gabi and Falco must combat their internal tensions over the supposed "devils" of Paradis.</p>

            <h1> Blades </h1>
            <p> The blades are made from an Ultrahard steel, which is both supple and strong, capable of rending Titan flesh. It can only be manufactured in the blast furnaces of factory cities. Soldiers usually carry more blades in boxes built at the sides of their thighs. </p>

            <h1> Thunder Spear </h1>
            <p> These weapons work as a two-stage rocket: an initial charge launches the projectile by pressing a special trigger in the handle of the device. The projectile, connected by a rope to the main engine, is launched with enough power to penetrate hardened Titan skin. However, when that rope is cut, the second charge is activated. This causes a tremendous explosion which makes the projectile penetrate even more into the target. Usually one was carried on each arm, but up to four can be carried with proper modification to the vertical maneuver gear, making eight in total. </p>

            <h1> Controller Grip </h1>
            <p> The inner workings of the controllers are a closely guarded secret. The top trigger fires the anchor with the bottom trigger firing compressed gas. Pulling the lever reels the wire back in, letting go makes it stop. The hammer switch located at the back allows the angle of fire for both anchor mechanisms to be adjusted while the auxiliary switches release and lock the blades in place.

            <p> Complex weight-shifting technology that employs full body encompassing fixed belts is required to make vertical maneuvers possible. The person shifts their entire weight to either side of their hips. The majority of that weight is applied to the bottom of their opposing foot.  </p>
